Course Project for Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data 
Richard Brown
Due: September 21, 2014
==================================================================

The intent of this project is to demonstrate mastery of data organization and cleaning techniques.
The raw experiment / dataset used for this project is described fully below in the original readme.

The objective was to create two tidy datasets. One that included all information in the original files
The other to create a summary text file that grouped results by study subject and by activity, displaying
the grouped average for all means and standard deviations in the data set. 

=========================================================================

The entire analysis was completed in one function called: run_analysis.R

The following 8 raw data files were used:

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

- 'test/subject_test.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.  

==========================================================================

Here were the steps followed to produce the tidy dataset:

- Appended features (column headings) to both the X_test and X_train data columns
- Renamed several column headings in the following data to usable and understandable language
	- y_test first column renamed "activity_code"
	- subject_test first column renamed "subject_code"
	- y_train first column renamed "activity_code"
	- subject_train first column renamed "subject_code"
	- activity_labels" columns renamed "activity_code" and "activity_name"
- Appended the subjects and activity codes to the x_test and x_train datasets
- Added an identifier to the end of the x_test and x_train datasets to allow future identification of a test or training record
- Merged the x_test and X_train datasets to get a combined table
- Joined new table with the activity_labels data set
- Performed the following cleaning tasks on the newly merged data set
	- Selected columns with only means and standard deviations in addition to subject, activity name etc
	- Condensed / gathered the data so that each column only displays one variable
	- Ordered the dataset in a logical fashion
- Result = tidy and comprehensive data set
- Final step: Created a separate, grouped data set summarized by the average measure (mean or standard dev)
for each subject (person), activity and measurement type.

==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
